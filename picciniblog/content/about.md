# Hi there, I'm Patrick Berlatto Piccini! 

Working with Back-End Development since 2020, I have developed medium-scale projects for large companies such as Ambev, Renner, LTD, Vivara, among others. Also, I developed solutions and innovations for the largest software house in Latin America, Linx, with companies such as Shell, Ipiranga, Rede Graal, among many others, using their systems.
Most of my experience comes down to Python, Node.js SQL, NoSQL, API-Rest and Microservices.
